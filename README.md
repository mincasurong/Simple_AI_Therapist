# Simple AI Therapist

This repository contains MATLAB code for a simple fuzzy logic-based AI therapist deployed in SUBAR, a lower limb exoskeletal robot for gait training. The AI therapist is designed to assist with personalized rehabilitation sessions by adapting to the patient's needs in real-time.

## Contents

- **[Simple_controller_AI_T.m](Simple_controller_AI_T.m)**: Main MATLAB script implementing the fuzzy logic-based AI therapist.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (for running the `.m` file)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/Simple_AI_Therapist.git
    cd Simple_AI_Therapist
    ```

2. Open `Simple_controller_AI_T.m` in MATLAB and run it to deploy the AI therapist in the SUBAR exoskeletal robot system.

## Fuzzy Logic-based AI Therapist

The AI therapist uses fuzzy logic to provide personalized gait training. The fuzzy logic system adjusts the therapy parameters based on the patient's performance and needs, ensuring an adaptive and responsive rehabilitation process.

### Key Features

- **Personalized Therapy**: Adapts to individual patient needs.
- **Real-time Adjustment**: Continuously adjusts parameters based on real-time feedback.
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Uses fuzzy logic to handle the uncertainties and variabilities in patient performance.

## Example

To run the AI therapist:
1. Open `Simple_controller_AI_T.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to initiate the AI therapist and observe its interaction with the patient.
